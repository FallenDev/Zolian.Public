Zolian is a different approach to the darkages universe. 
This server is based on Dungeons & Dragons, Final Fantasy, Diablo 3, Zelda, Elder Scrolls, 
World of Warcraft and many other MMORPGs. Many of the grind mechanics are from traditional Hack
and Slashers that you know and love. Here you'll be able to build a character up and play either
with friends or run solo. The main focus of Zolian is to balance the characters while breathing
new life into Nexon's Darkages. That includes new music, new maps, classes, races, and pvp zones
much like you would see in open world MMOs.
